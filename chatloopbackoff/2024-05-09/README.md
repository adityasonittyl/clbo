### Summary

- Armada
  - CNCF Sandbox Project (since 2022)
  - What?
    - Armada is a system built on top of Kubernetes for running batch workloads.
  - Why?
    - Armada addresses the following limitations of Kubernetes:
      1. Armada is designed to effectively schedule jobs across many Kubernetes clusters. Many thousands of nodes can be managed by Armada in this way.
      2. Armada performs queueing and scheduling out-of-cluster using a specialized storage layer. This allows Armada to maintain queues composed of millions of jobs.
      3. Armada includes a novel multi-Kubernetes cluster scheduler

### TODO / Questions / Musings

- Getting Started with Armada
  - Install the operator from https://github.com/armadaproject/armada-operator
  - Was not able to install, we found installation [bugs](https://github.com/armadaproject/armada/issues/3575). Happy to schedule part 2 when the project fixes these problems.
