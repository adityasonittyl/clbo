### Summary

- What even is Backstage?
  - What is a developer portal?
- Why a live demo with backstage probably isn't a good idea on stream? (When you're doing it live)
  - Deploying Backstage isn't necessarily an involved process, but providing a meaningful demo live would be.
- A means of accelerating new engineer onboarding (think zero-to-merge)
- I correct a misconception of mine: It's now easy to rebuild-and-deploy an instance of Backstage

### TODO / Questions
- Hey @onlydole are we bringing back Tech Radars? :) 
- Is the CostInsightsApi meant to integrate with other plugins for cloud providers / ???
