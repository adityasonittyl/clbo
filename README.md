Entertainment and education in the Cloud Native ecosystem

## ChatLoopBackOff ([Episodes](chatloopbackoff/))

A weekly [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2PnyOsrsCbR_kqjCKfPObHK) that does a laid back deep dive into a Cloud Native topic or project. Often the presenter goes in (mostly) blind, and the presenter and audience learn together.

## ClashLoopBackOff

A series of technical challenges that pit two community members against each other and against the clock. Usually done live at KubeCons.
