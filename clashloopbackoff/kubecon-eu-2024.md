# ClashLoop: Paris 2024 Edition

## Match One

### Abdel Sghiouar vs Mitch (Est Start time: 6:30p)

- “Sup Gamers” - Deploy a Valheim server
- **“Live LiveStream” - Set up an RTSP server and broadcast your laptop webcam to your phone through it**
- “HonkCTL Scramble” - Public kubeconfig posted 3min before you get access to the cluster, secure it

**Winner: Abdel** 

Abdel went a SaaS route, choosing to use StreamYard and YouTube on his phone to accomplish the task. 

Mitch took an "early lead" using VLC, but ran into issues trying to find his local stream due to WiFi limitations.

## Match Two

### Kaslin Fields vs Christoph Blecker (Est Start time: 7:15p)

- “Help! My cluster is broken!” - Fix the cluster fastest
- **"I needed an AI task" - Deploy KubeRay with autoscaling**
- “Can’t you just fix this” - Here is a link to a GitHub issue. Best (not first) PR wins.

**Winner: Kaslin**

Both competitors were neck and neck, however in the end Kaslin had more "autoscaling" bits setup and inched out the win.
